# Window Buttons Extension

This is an extension for Gnome 3.38 which puts minimize and close buttons in the top panel.

## Installation

The only way to install for now is manually through git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PWall2222/WB.git
cd WB
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
cp wb@pwall.github.com ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
gnome-extensions enable wb@pwall.github.com
```

### Credits

I took inspiration and the css/icons from danielkza [extension](https://github.com/danielkza/Gnome-Shell-Window-Buttons-Extension/).
